## Description

_Salad Bowl is a fast-paced word-guessing party game meant for teams of two. On each team's turn, one person (the 'actor') is assigned a series of words and tries to get their partner (the 'guesser') to guess as many words as they can in 60 seconds. The game has three rounds, each of which have their own rules. This Android app is meant to be passed around during the game, and will make the game flow significantly more quickly and smoothly. Users first select a number of teams and a letter to generate the game word list from. When guessers successfully guess a word, the actor can shake their device to indicate a correct answer and go to the next word. After three rounds, points are added up and a winner is crowned! Have fun!_
